###Problem Statement
We have to do low level design for a Cache system. Cache that we will design will have to support following operations:

1. Put: This will allow user to put a value against a key in the cache. 
2. Get: This will allow user to get the previously saved value using key.
3. Eviction: Cache should also support removal of some key in case cache is full, and we try to add new key value.

Expectations:
- Code should be functionally correct.
- Code should be modular and readable. Clean and professional level code.
- Code should be extensible and scalable. Means it should be able to accommodate new requirements with minimal changes.
- Code should have good OOPs design.
