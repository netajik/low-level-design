Here is the description of the question:

1. The delivery agent brings the package near the system.

2. The agent scans the QR code on the package to retrieve information about the product.

3. Product listing is also there so that when a new product comes, he can list it and decide what sort of storage it can be put in.

4. There are 3 types of storage: Small, Medium, and Large.
   Small packages can be put in medium and large storage. Same for the other storage.

5. When the QR is scanned, the appropriate locker is opened we can put it there.

6. Each locker is at a certain distance from the system, so the system takes care of that as well.

7. We can empty the locker as well.

8. If we want a certain product, we can check in the system and then go to the locker to get that.
