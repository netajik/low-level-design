### Dependency Inversion principle

1. The Dependency Inversion principle states that our classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions.

2. "If the OCP states the goal of OO architecture, the DIP states the primary mechanism".

We want our classes to be open to extension, so we have reorganized our dependencies to depend on interfaces instead of concrete classes.
