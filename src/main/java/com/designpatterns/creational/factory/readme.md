Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
It provides a way to create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client and refers to the newly created object through a common interface. The main purpose of the Factory pattern is to allow for flexibility in creating different types of objects, while still adhering to the principle of keeping the code decoupled and maintainable.

In simple terms, a Factory pattern provides a way to create objects of different types based on some input parameter, without exposing the details of object creation to the client. This can be particularly useful in situations where object creation is a complex process, or when there is a need to create different types of objects based on some external factors.
